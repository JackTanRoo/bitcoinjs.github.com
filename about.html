  <div class="grid_12">
    <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
    <p>BitcoinJS is built around the advantages of the modern JavaScript stack. We feel that the requirements of Bitcoin clients and servers match very well the functionality offered by JavaScript-based environments.</p>
  </div>
  <ul class="services-list">
    <li> <span class="process">1</span>
      <p><strong>Security</strong> - In the browser, JavaScript had to withstand almost two decades worth of attacks and its virtual machines are now some of the most battle-hardened and reviewed pieces of software available.</p>
    </li>
    <li> <span class="process">2</span>
      <p><strong>Performance</strong> - Thanks to an arms race between Google, Mozilla, Microsoft and Apple, JavaScript is now one of the fastest interpreted languages available. BitcoinJS uses native extensions in Node.js and Phonegap for a further boost.</p>
    </li>
    <li> <span class="process">3</span>
      <p><strong>Portability</strong> - The HTML5 platform is one of the most widely supported environments with support on almost any desktop and mobile device. Therefore BitcoinJS can provide a consistent set of features for users on all platforms.</p>
    </li>
    <li> <span class="process">4</span>
      <p><strong>Usability</strong> - BitcoinJS can run in the browser allowing an unparalleled user experience for first time users. There is no other technology that allows users to try Bitcoin so quickly and risk-free.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

    <h3>Status</h3>
    <p>BitcoinJS is still a young project, but we lead the race among alternative implementations with a complete script interpreter, mining support, JSON-RPC support and a client/GUI implementation. Several online wallet providers already use BitcoinJS in production.</p>
